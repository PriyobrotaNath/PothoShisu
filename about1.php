The 'PothoshisurAlo' project will work on the donation of street children's school. Many of us would like to work with street children or help street children, but we know how to work or how we will help it, so that's our little effort. ‘PothoshisurAlo’ is a not-for-profit, voluntary-based development organization founded in 2019.  The organization was initiated by a group of educated social and human rights activists and educators aiming to improve the life chances of children forced to live in extreme difficulties on the streets and also to address the needs of the growing number of vulnerable street children in Bangladesh.

  <center><h1>OUR VISION </h1></center>
  
	  
    </div>
<h4 style="color:white;font-weight: bold;font-size:28;">
 A successful country is built up by successful entities within it and successful entities depend upon successful people, who ultimately arise from children who flourish and succeed.  So, if we want to make our nation prosperous and ensure our position as a developed country in the world, we must pay attention to our children.  We have to start our ambitious journey actively nurturing the development and wellbeing of our children.
If we want to make our nation prosperous we must pay attention to our children.
Undoubtedly our country Bangladesh is currently a developing country and we acknowledge that we have many challenges but with hope in our hearts, the vision of our destination will gradually be realized by multi-dimensional development work. We know we have problems and we are trying to solve them but some of them are so alarming and dangerous that one of them is enough to destroy our country and national goals.  The issue of Street Children is of deep concern to the well-being of our nation.  As children, they are very easily subject to abuse.  Besides this, owing to their extreme poverty, they suffer from various diseases and the effects of malnutrition. Thus, simply to survive, they become involved in dangerous crimes like terrorist activities, drug selling, smuggling, etc.
to survive children get involved in terrorist activities, drug selling, smuggling.
So, we think that it is high time to stop the root causes of our young citizens becoming street children and help those who are currently so vulnerable return home or be given the opportunity to thrive in a safe zone for the betterment of their future.  With the backing of our government, we as ‘PothoshisurAlo’ think that we should endeavor to free our country of street children and we also believe that with a united approach we will overcome this problem.
